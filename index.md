# Current Research Interests

- Spatially adaptive SPH, especially regarding consistency and validation of my prior research in an engineering context
- Boundary Handling in SPH and how non-optimal solutions could improve convergence
- Machine Learning and SPH w.r.t. learning surrogate models
- Differentiable/Adjoint SPH methods for target function based optimization
- Particle Shifting with neural networks and neural networks with particle shifting
